To get started, if you haven't already, please download and install Git https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.40.1.windows.1/Git-2.40.1-64-bit.exe

Follow the prompts and don't worry too much about changing settings, just hit next

Once installed, I'd suggest downloading and installing Github Desktop https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32 this will give you a GUI application to manage repositories

You can either open a command prompt or PowerShell window, navigate to a new folder and use the command ```git pull https://github.com/BillySnooze/missile-command-processing/``` or you can use the Github Desktop app to pull the repository onto your local machine.

When making changes, use ```git commit``` Once you’ve saved your files, you need to commit them - this means the changes you have made to files in your repo will be saved as a version of the repo, and your changes are now ready to go up on GitHub (the online copy of the repository)

Before you send your changes to Github, you need to pull with ```git pull``` i.e. make sure you are completely up to date with the latest version of the online version of the files - other people could have been working on them even if you haven’t. You should always pull before you start editing and before you push.

Once you are up to date, you can push your changes with ```git push```- at this point in time your local copy and the online copy of the files will be the same

Each file on GitHub has a history, so instead of having many files like Dissertation_1st_May.R, Dissertation_2nd_May.R, you can have only one and by exploring its history, you can see what it looked at different points in time.
